## Installation

### Backend (Spring Boot)

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cryptography-tool.git
   cd cryptography-tool

2. Navigate to the backend directory:

bash
Copy code
cd backend
Build and run the Spring Boot application:

bash
Copy code
./mvnw spring-boot:run
The backend will run on http://localhost:8080.

3. Frontend (React)

npm start
The frontend will run on http://localhost:3000.

4. Usage
   1. Open the React application in your browser: http://localhost:3000.
   2. Enter the text you want to encrypt or decrypt.
   3. Select the algorithm and provide the required key.
   4. Click on "Encrypt" or "Decrypt" to get the result.
