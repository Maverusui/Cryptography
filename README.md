## Installation

### Backend (Spring Boot)

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cryptography-tool.git
   cd cryptography-tool

2. Navigate to the backend directory:

```bash
   cd backend

3. Build and run the Spring Boot application:

```bash
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run

The backend will run on http://localhost:8080.

4. Frontend (React)
Navigate to the frontend directory:

```bash
   cd frontend
5. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install

6. Start the React application:

```bash
   npm start

The frontend will run on http://localhost:3000.

### Usage
   1. Open the React application in your browser: http://localhost:3000.
   2. Enter the text you want to encrypt or decrypt.
   3. Select the algorithm and provide the required key.
   4. Click on "Encrypt" or "Decrypt" to get the result.
